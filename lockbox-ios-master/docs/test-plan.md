## Accessibility

There are a number of best practices and accessibility features available to iOS developers and we intend to build and test for:

## 1. VoiceOver support

The reading of on-screen interface items and objects. Testing for:

- All on-screen navigation and button titles are read
- All on-screen alerts and popovers (interrupting the interface) are read
- All labels and text elements on screen are read
- Interaction elements like input boxes and filters have meaningful instructions
- Links to open websites are clearly indicated and read

## 2. User interface design

The interface is legible and tappable by designing and testing for:

- adequate color contrasts (e.g.: no light text on light background)
- button and input sizes (e.g.: large enough to tap into easily and consistently)
- text sizes follow system adjustment (i.e. respect "Larger Text" setting)

**MVP Testing and Results documented at:**

### Out of Scope

1. Internal [metrics/analytics][4] review and testing (see [metrics.md][5])
2. Internal [security review][6] (performed separately)
